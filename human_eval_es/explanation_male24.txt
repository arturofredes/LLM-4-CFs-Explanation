Based on the analysis of your credit assessment and the comparison with individuals who have achieved a positive credit outcome, several key areas can be identified to help improve your chances of obtaining a good credit rating. Here's a clear and actionable explanation:

1. **Increase Your Credit Amount**: 
   - The analysis shows that individuals with higher credit amounts tend to achieve a better credit rating. Consider applying for a higher credit amount if your financial situation allows it. This could signal to the credit system that you are capable of managing larger sums responsibly.

2. **Personal Status**: 
   - While this factor is less within your control, the data indicates that being female and having a status of divorced, separated, or married is associated with better credit outcomes. If you are in a position to update your personal status information accurately, ensure it is reflected in your records.

3. **Consider Age Factor**:
   - Older individuals tend to have better credit ratings. While age is not something you can change, being aware that credit history improves over time can help you focus on maintaining a good credit record consistently.

4. **Job Type Flexibility**:
   - Although less frequently observed, having a job categorized as "unemployed/unskilled - non-resident" has still led to positive outcomes, suggesting that job diversity is possible for good credit. If you are considering a job switch, ensure that your new role does not adversely affect your credit evaluation.

5. **Foreign Worker Status**:
   - While this rule was not strongly supported by the data, being a non-foreign worker might contribute positively. Ensure that your status as a foreign or non-foreign worker is correctly recorded.

### Key Actions to Improve Credit:
- **Apply for a Higher Credit Amount:** If feasible, increasing your credit amount can improve your credit rating.
- **Accurate Personal Status Information:** Ensure your personal status is updated and accurately reflected in your credit records.
- **Maintain a Strong Credit History Over Time:** Consistently good credit behavior improves your rating as you age.
- **Evaluate Job Changes Carefully:** Consider the impact of job switches on your credit assessment.

These steps can significantly influence your credit standing and help you move towards a positive credit assessment. Remember, maintaining good financial habits and regularly reviewing your credit report for accuracy are foundational steps in achieving a better credit status.
