Based on the analysis of your credit assessment, here are some key factors that can significantly influence your credit evaluation and steps you can take to improve your chances of achieving a positive credit rating:

### Key Factors and Recommendations

1. **Foreign Worker Status**:
   - **Observation**: Being a foreign worker with a status of `1` (as opposed to `0`) is highly associated with positive credit assessments.
   - **Action**: Ensure that your status as a foreign worker is correctly reported and, if applicable, seek to understand and possibly improve your residency or work status to align with this positive indicator.

2. **Age**:
   - **Observation**: Older age is associated with better credit outcomes.
   - **Action**: While age itself isn't something you can change, this highlights the importance of establishing a stable and positive credit history over time. Consistently managing your credit responsibly can improve your rating as you age.

3. **Shorter Credit Duration**:
   - **Observation**: Having a shorter credit duration (e.g., less than 24 months) is linked to a positive credit assessment.
   - **Action**: Consider opting for shorter-term loans where feasible. Paying off existing loans in a shorter timeframe can also positively impact your credit assessment.

4. **Savings Account/Bonds**:
   - **Observation**: Having a higher amount in savings (between 100 and 500 DM) is associated with a positive credit outcome.
   - **Action**: Focus on increasing your savings. Maintaining a balance in your savings account that falls within this range can improve your credit standing.

5. **Co-applicant**:
   - **Observation**: Having a co-applicant for your credit application is associated with a positive outcome.
   - **Action**: If possible, consider applying for credit with a co-applicant. This can provide additional security to lenders and improve your chances of a positive credit assessment.

6. **Personal Status and Sex**:
   - **Observation**: Being a single male is associated with a positive credit assessment.
   - **Action**: While personal status and sex are not easily changed, understanding this bias can help you be more strategic in your financial planning and advocacy for fair lending practices.

### Summary

To improve your credit assessment:

- **Check and, if applicable, update your foreign worker status** to ensure it aligns positively.
- **Build a strong, consistent credit history** over time.
- **Opt for shorter credit durations** when possible.
- **Increase your savings** to fall within the favorable range.
- **Consider applying with a co-applicant** if you can.
- **Be aware of biases** based on personal status and sex, and plan strategically.

Taking these steps can significantly influence your credit assessment and move you towards a more favorable outcome.
