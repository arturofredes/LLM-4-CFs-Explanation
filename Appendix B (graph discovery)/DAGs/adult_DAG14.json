Marital status is a condition or fact regarding whether a person is single, married, divorced, etc. This is usually determined by the person's actions, decisions, or events that happen in their life.\n\nOn the other hand, gender is typically understood as a biological and physiological characteristic that differentiates males from females. It is determined at birth and generally doesn't change through a person's life.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n1. Changing X causes a change in Y: This implies that changing a person's marital status will change their gender. Biologically and physiologically, this is not possible. A person's gender cannot be changed by their marital status.\n\n-1. Changing Y causes a change in X: This implies that changing a person's gender will change their marital status. While gender can potentially influence societal roles and expectations that could indirectly influence marital status, it doesn't directly cause a change in marital status. A person can change their gender without it necessarily changing their marital status.\n\n0.

Marital status could potentially affect work hours if, for example, a person chooses to work less to spend more time with their spouse or family.
