There are many other factors that could influence both marital status and income, and the relationship between the two is likely to be complex and multifaceted.\n\nTherefore, it's more likely that changing X (marital status) could cause a change in Y (income), but this is not a certain or direct causal relationship, and there could be many other factors at play.\n",
