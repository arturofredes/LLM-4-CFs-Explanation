Changing your occupation could potentially lead to a change in marital status. For example, someone who has a high-stress, high-demand job might be more likely to get divorced. However, again, this is not a direct cause-and-effect relationship. It's not the change in occupation that causes the change in marital status, but rather the change in lifestyle and stress levels that come with the change in occupation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer would be that there is no direct causal relationship between marital status and occupation. \n",
