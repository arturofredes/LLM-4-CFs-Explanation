The assistant explains that a change in education level (X) can lead to a change in income (Y), as higher education often results in better job opportunities and thus higher income. However, a change in income (Y) does not necessarily lead to a change in education level (X), as income can increase or decrease due to various factors unrelated to education. Therefore, the assistant correctly concludes that the cause-and-effect relationship is more likely to be that changing X causes a change in Y. \n"
