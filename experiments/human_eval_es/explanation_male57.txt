Based on the analysis of your credit assessment, here are some actionable steps you can take to improve your credit status:

1. **Shorten Your Loan Duration**:
   - Our analysis shows that shorter loan durations can lead to better credit assessments. If possible, consider opting for a shorter term when applying for new credit. For example, reducing the duration from 36 months to a shorter period can significantly improve your credit evaluation.

2. **Maintain a Positive Credit History**:
   - A history of timely repayment of previous credits is crucial. Ensure that you pay off all your credits on time. Avoid delays in payments, as a positive credit history greatly increases the likelihood of a favorable credit assessment.

3. **Reduce Your Installment Rate**:
   - Lower installment rates as a percentage of your disposable income can lead to better credit assessments. Try to manage your finances in a way that your installment rate is as low as possible.

4. **Limit the Number of Existing Credits**:
   - Having fewer existing credits at the bank can improve your credit assessment. If you have multiple credits, consider paying some off before applying for new credit.

5. **Aim for a Higher Class Value**:
   - The analysis indicates that a higher class value is associated with a positive credit assessment. While this is a more complex aspect tied to various factors, focusing on improving other areas (like credit history, installment rate, and loan duration) can indirectly help in achieving a higher class value.

By paying attention to these factors and making strategic changes, you can improve your chances of receiving a positive credit assessment. Focus on shortening your loan durations, maintaining a positive credit history, reducing your installment rates, and limiting the number of existing credits. These steps can make a substantial difference in your credit status.
