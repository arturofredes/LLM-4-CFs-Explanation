Based on the analysis of your credit assessment, several factors significantly influence the likelihood of achieving a positive credit outcome. Here are actionable steps you can take to improve your credit standing:

1. **Credit Amount**: 
   - **Increase Your Credit Amount**: The analysis shows that higher credit amounts are associated with positive credit outcomes. If possible, consider ways to responsibly increase your credit limit. This could involve discussing with your bank or financial institution about increasing your credit line.

2. **Installment Rate**: 
   - **Reduce Your Installment Rate**: Lower installment rates in percentage of disposable income are linked to better credit outcomes. Try to negotiate lower interest rates or extend the repayment period to reduce your monthly installment rate.

3. **Savings Account/Bonds**: 
   - **Enhance Your Savings**: Having savings accounts or bonds amounting to 1000 DM or more is associated with positive credit outcomes. Focus on building up your savings, which can also serve as a financial buffer in times of need.

4. **Age**: 
   - **Leverage Age Wisdom**: The analysis indicates that increased age is associated with positive outcomes. While you can't change your age, consider using your experience and stability to your advantage when applying for credit.

5. **Other Installment Plans**: 
   - **Consider Other Installment Plans**: Having other installment plans, such as those from stores or banks, is linked to positive credit outcomes. Explore the possibility of diversifying your credit portfolio with other installment plans.

6. **Foreign Worker Status**: 
   - **Embrace Your Foreign Worker Status**: If you are a foreign worker, this is positively associated with credit outcomes. Make sure your employment status is accurately reflected in your credit application.

**Most Important Steps:**
- **Focus on Increasing Your Credit Amount**: Since this rule is followed by the highest number of counterfactuals, it is the most critical factor.
- **Leverage Your Foreign Worker Status**: This is another highly influential factor you can use to your advantage.

**Action Plan**:
- Speak with your bank about safely increasing your credit limit.
- Work on reducing your installment rates by negotiating better terms.
- Build up your savings to meet or exceed the 1000 DM threshold.
- If applicable, ensure that your status as a foreign worker is correctly documented in your credit applications.

By focusing on these key areas, you can improve your chances of moving to a positive credit class.
