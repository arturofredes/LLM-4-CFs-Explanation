Based on the analysis of factors influencing credit outcomes, here are some targeted recommendations to help improve your chances of obtaining a positive credit rating:

1. **Foreign Worker Status**: Our analysis shows that being a foreign worker is strongly associated with positive credit outcomes. This finding suggests that foreign worker status might be viewed favorably by lenders in this dataset. While this may not be something you can change, it's an interesting observation to keep in mind.

2. **Own Real Estate Property**: Owning real estate is linked to positive credit outcomes. If feasible, investing in property or showing evidence of real estate ownership can improve your credit standing.

3. **Increase Existing Credits at the Bank**: Having more existing credits at the bank is associated with better credit outcomes. If you currently have only one credit with the bank, consider managing additional credits responsibly to demonstrate your creditworthiness.

4. **Lower Installment Rates**: Lowering your installment rates, which represent the percentage of your disposable income that goes towards installment payments, can positively impact your credit assessment. Aim to keep your installment rates as low as possible by negotiating better terms or paying off high-interest debts.

5. **Personal Status and Guarantors**: Certain personal statuses, such as being a "male: divorced/separated" with a guarantor, have shown positive effects on credit outcomes. If applicable, having a guarantor for your credits might improve your credit rating.

6. **Credit Amount**: Although less impactful than the previous factors, higher credit amounts are associated with positive outcomes. If you have the financial flexibility, consider taking on slightly higher credit amounts and managing them well to build a better credit profile.

To summarize, focusing on these key areas—owning real estate, managing multiple credits responsibly, lowering your installment rates, and, where possible, having a guarantor—can make a significant difference in improving your credit rating. While some factors may be beyond your control, strategic financial decisions and planning can greatly enhance your credit prospects.
