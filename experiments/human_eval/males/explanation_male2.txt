Based on the results obtained from the analysis, it's clear that certain factors significantly influence the likelihood of achieving a positive credit assessment. Here's a plain language explanation targeting improvement:

1. **Diversify the Purpose of Your Credit**: The analysis shows that diversifying the purpose of your credit, such as applying for credit for a car (new or used), domestic appliances, or even business purposes, can increase your chances of approval. Consider exploring different credit purposes if possible.

2. **Build and Maintain Property**: Owning significant property, such as having a building society savings agreement or life insurance, is shown to be beneficial. If you're able to, investing in such property types can positively impact your credit assessment.

3. **Job Stability and Employment Duration**: Being employed as a skilled employee or official and having a longer employment duration significantly improve your chances. If you're currently in an unstable job or have a short employment history, prioritizing job stability and aiming for longer tenures can be advantageous.

4. **Foreign Worker Status**: The analysis indicates that being a foreign worker does not adversely affect your creditworthiness. Therefore, if this applies to you, rest assured that your foreign worker status is not a barrier to positive credit assessment outcomes.

5. **Credit History**: Having a more lenient or even a critical credit history can still lead to positive outcomes. This suggests that maintaining at least some credit activity, even if not perfect, is better than having no credit history at all.

6. **Age**: Although less impactful than other factors, older age in combination with the same financial conditions seems to improve creditworthiness. While you cannot change your age, understanding that credit systems may view older applicants more favorably under certain conditions can be helpful.

7. **Savings Account/Bonds**: While not highlighted as highly impactful in this specific analysis, having some savings in the form of bonds or a savings account can still be beneficial. Consider increasing your savings if possible.

8. **Other Factors**: Factors such as having no other debtors/guarantors, owning your residence, and having no additional installment plans also play a role in positive credit assessments. Aim to manage your finances in a way that aligns with these factors where feasible.

To improve your chances of moving to a positive credit assessment, focus on diversifying the purpose of your credit, building and maintaining significant property, enhancing job stability, and maintaining a credit history. While some factors like age and foreign worker status are less controllable, understanding their impact can help you navigate the credit assessment process more effectively.
