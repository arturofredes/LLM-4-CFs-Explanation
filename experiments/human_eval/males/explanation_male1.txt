Based on the analysis of the data and the observed patterns, here are some actionable steps you can take to improve your chances of receiving a positive credit assessment:

### Key Areas for Improvement:

1. **Status of Existing Checking Account:**
   - **Current Status:** Your checking account status is "< 0 DM".
   - **Action to Take:** Opening a checking account with a balance of at least 200 DM or more, or having no checking account at all, can significantly improve your credit assessment. Consider maintaining a higher balance in your checking account.

2. **Savings Account/Bonds:**
   - **Current Status:** Your savings account balance is "< 100 DM".
   - **Action to Take:** While the amount in your savings account is less critical compared to your checking account, having higher savings can still positively influence your credit assessment. Aim to save more and increase the balance in your savings account.

3. **Property Ownership:**
   - **Current Status:** You currently have "unknown/no property".
   - **Action to Take:** Owning real estate property can lead to a positive credit assessment. If feasible, consider investing in real estate as it can improve your creditworthiness.

4. **Foreign Worker Status:**
   - **Current Status:** You are identified as a "foreign worker".
   - **Action to Take:** While changing your foreign worker status isn't practical advice, this highlights the importance of establishing a stable and recognized financial presence in the country where you seek credit.

5. **Job Type:**
   - **Current Status:** Your job is as a "skilled employee / official".
   - **Action to Take:** Continue to maintain or enhance your skills and professional standing. Occupations as a skilled employee or official are generally favorable for credit assessments. Consider seeking advancements or certifications in your field to further solidify your job stability and income.

### Additional Observations:
- Certain attributes like **Credit History, Purpose, Credit Amount, Present Employment Since, Installment Rate, Personal Status and Sex, Other Debtors/Guarantors, Age, Other Installment Plans, Housing, Number of Existing Credits, Number of People Being Liable to Provide Maintenance, and Telephone** were constant across both negative and positive outcomes. This suggests that focusing on the above key areas will be more impactful in changing your credit assessment outcome.

### Summary:
To improve your chances of receiving a positive credit assessment, focus on maintaining a higher balance in your checking account, increasing your savings, and if possible, investing in property. Continue to sustain or improve your professional skills and job stability. While some factors like foreign worker status are less within your control, being aware of these elements can help you make informed decisions and strategic improvements to your financial profile.

By taking these steps, you can significantly enhance your creditworthiness and improve your overall financial standing.
