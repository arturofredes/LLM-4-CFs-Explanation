Based on the analysis of the credit assessment, several factors significantly impact the likelihood of achieving a positive credit outcome. Here's a clear explanation to help you improve your chances of obtaining a better credit assessment:

### Prioritize Reducing Existing Credits:
The most impactful change you can make is to reduce the number of existing credits you have at this bank. The analysis shows that having fewer existing credits (e.g., 2 or 3 instead of 4) is strongly associated with positive credit outcomes. Consider consolidating your debts or paying off some existing credits to lower the number.

### Consider Having a Guarantor:
Another important factor is having a guarantor instead of a co-applicant. The data indicates that having a guarantor is linked to better credit assessments. If possible, find a guarantor who can back your credit application.

### Employment Stability:
Longer employment duration is also associated with better credit outcomes. While this might take time, aiming for job stability and a longer tenure at your current job can positively influence your credit assessment. 

### Foreign Worker Status:
Not being a foreign worker appears to be linked to better credit assessments. While this is not something you can change, it's important to be aware of how this factor might be affecting your credit outcome.

### Home Ownership:
Owning a house rather than renting is associated with positive credit outcomes. If feasible, consider steps toward home ownership, as it might improve your credit standing.

### Increase Credit Amount:
Higher credit amounts are also linked to better credit assessments. While this might seem counterintuitive, it could be related to the perceived ability to handle larger financial responsibilities. If appropriate and within your means, consider applying for a higher credit amount.

### Summary:
1. **Reduce Number of Existing Credits**: Aim to lower the number of existing credits you have at this bank.
2. **Consider Having a Guarantor**: If possible, find a guarantor for your credit application.
3. **Seek Employment Stability**: Aim for longer tenure in your current job to show employment stability.
4. **Be Aware of Foreign Worker Status**: Recognize the impact of foreign worker status on your credit outcome.
5. **Consider Home Ownership**: If feasible, steps towards owning a house could positively influence your credit.
6. **Evaluate Higher Credit Amounts**: If within your means, applying for a higher credit amount may improve your assessment.

By focusing on these areas, you can take strategic steps to improve your credit assessment outcome.
