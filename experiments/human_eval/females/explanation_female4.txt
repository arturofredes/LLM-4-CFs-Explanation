Based on the analysis of the data and the results obtained, several factors have been identified that significantly influence the likelihood of achieving a positive credit assessment. Here’s a plain language explanation to help you understand these factors and improve your chances of moving to a positive credit class:

### Key Factors to Improve Your Credit Assessment

1. **Property Ownership:**
   - **Importance:** This is one of the most influential factors.
   - **Action:** Owning real estate, having a building society savings agreement, or life insurance is associated with a positive credit assessment. If possible, consider investing in property or securing life insurance as these can significantly improve your credit standing.

2. **Occupation (Job):**
   - **Importance:** This is also highly influential.
   - **Action:** Being in management, self-employed, or holding a highly qualified employment position is associated with a positive credit assessment. If you’re considering a job change or career advancement, aiming for roles within these categories can positively impact your credit assessment.

3. **Foreign Worker Status:**
   - **Importance:** This factor has a strong influence.
   - **Action:** Being a foreign worker is linked to a positive credit assessment. While this status may not be something you can change easily, understanding its influence can help you leverage other factors more effectively.

4. **Age:**
   - **Importance:** This factor is also significant.
   - **Action:** While age is something you cannot change, being aware that older age tends to be associated with a positive credit assessment can guide you to focus more on other actionable factors.

### Additional Factors to Consider

1. **Savings Account/Bonds:**
   - **Action:** Having a high balance in a savings account (>= 1000 DM) is associated with a positive credit assessment. If possible, aim to increase your savings.

2. **Checking Account Status:**
   - **Action:** Having no checking account or maintaining a balance of 0 <= ... < 200 DM can lead to a positive assessment. While completely closing a checking account might not be practical, managing the balance effectively is important.

### Less Influential or Neutral Factors

These factors appear in both positive and negative outcomes, indicating that they do not significantly influence the credit assessment:
- Credit history
- Purpose of the credit (e.g., car (new))
- Installment rate in percentage of disposable income
- Personal status and sex
- Housing status
- Other installment plans
- Number of existing credits at the bank
- Number of people being liable to provide maintenance
- Telephone status

### Summary

To improve your chances of moving to a positive credit class, focus on property ownership, advancing in your career to more qualified roles, and increasing your savings. While some factors like age and foreign worker status are less actionable, understanding their influence can help you prioritize the areas where you can make a tangible difference.

Taking strategic steps in these areas can significantly enhance your credit standing and improve your overall financial health.
