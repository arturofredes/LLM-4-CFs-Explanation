Based on the analysis of the factors influencing the credit assessment, we have identified several areas where changes could potentially improve your credit outcome. Here are some actionable insights:

1. **Status of Existing Checking Account:**
   - **Observation:** The presence of "no checking account" status appears frequently in positive outcomes.
   - **Action:** If possible, consider closing any existing checking accounts or transitioning to a financial status where you do not maintain a checking account. This change might positively impact your credit assessment.

2. **Credit Amount:**
   - **Observation:** Higher credit amounts are associated with positive outcomes.
   - **Action:** If feasible, consider increasing the credit amount you're applying for. While this might seem counterintuitive, higher credit amounts are often perceived as less risky if backed by a strong repayment history.

3. **Savings Account/Bonds:**
   - **Observation:** Having "unknown/no savings account" is linked to positive outcomes.
   - **Action:** Evaluate the possibility of either not maintaining a savings account or ensuring that your savings account status is not reported. This could help in aligning your profile with those who have received positive credit assessments.

4. **Age:**
   - **Observation:** Older age correlates with positive outcomes.
   - **Action:** While you cannot change your age, demonstrating financial stability and experience through other means might help. For instance, showcasing long-term employment or a stable income history could serve as proxies for the maturity that often comes with age.

5. **Purpose of Credit:**
   - **Observation:** Purposes like "furniture/equipment" are associated with positive outcomes compared to "car (new)".
   - **Action:** Reconsider the reason for your credit application. If applicable, you might want to reapply with a different purpose that is perceived more favorably, such as for "furniture/equipment" rather than a new car.

6. **Foreign Worker Status:**
   - **Observation:** Being a foreign worker is associated with positive outcomes.
   - **Action:** This factor is consistent across both negative and positive outcomes, suggesting it may not be a decisive factor on its own. However, maintain this status as it aligns with positive cases.

### Key Takeaways:
- **No Checking Account:** Transition to having no checking account if possible.
- **Increase Credit Amount:** Aim for a higher credit amount if it is within your means to do so responsibly.
- **Savings Account:** Evaluate the status of your savings account and consider having it as "unknown/no savings."
- **Purpose of Credit:** Reassess and potentially change the purpose of your credit application to something more favorably viewed like "furniture/equipment."

By focusing on these specific areas, you can increase your chances of improving your credit assessment outcome. These changes, if feasible for your situation, could align your profile more closely with those who have achieved positive credit assessments.
