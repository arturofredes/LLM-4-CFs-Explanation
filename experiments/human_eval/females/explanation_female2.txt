### Explanation

Based on the analysis, several key factors significantly influence the likelihood of obtaining a positive credit assessment. Here's a straightforward explanation to help you improve your creditworthiness:

1. **Reduce Your Installment Rate**: A lower installment rate as a percentage of your disposable income is strongly associated with a positive credit assessment. Aim to reduce your debt obligations or increase your disposable income to lower this rate. For example, if your current installment rate is 4%, reducing it to around 2% can be beneficial.

2. **Increase Your Savings**: Having a higher balance in your savings account or bonds is a strong indicator of financial stability. Specifically, having at least 1000 DM in savings significantly increases your chances of a positive credit assessment. If possible, strive to save more to reach this threshold.

3. **Consider Having a Guarantor**: The presence of a guarantor can positively influence your credit assessment. If you have someone who can guarantee your credit, it may improve your chances of being assessed favorably.

4. **Job Type Matters**: Your job type plays a role in your credit assessment. Jobs categorized under management, self-employed, or highly qualified employment are viewed more favorably compared to unskilled jobs. If possible, aim for career advancement or seek opportunities that offer higher qualifications.

5. **Age Factor**: Older individuals tend to receive better credit assessments. While you cannot change your age, demonstrating financial responsibility over time will naturally improve your creditworthiness.

6. **Residency Status**: Being a non-foreign worker is associated with better credit assessments. While this may not be something you can change, understanding its impact can help you manage other aspects more effectively.

### Action Steps

1. **Financial Management**: Focus on reducing your installment rates and increasing your savings. This can be achieved through budgeting, reducing unnecessary expenses, and possibly increasing your income.

2. **Seek a Guarantor**: If you can, find a reliable guarantor who can co-sign your credit applications.

3. **Career Development**: Look for opportunities to advance your career into roles that are viewed more favorably by credit assessors, such as management or highly skilled positions.

4. **Long-Term Planning**: Understand that improving your creditworthiness may take time and consistent effort in managing your finances responsibly.

By focusing on these areas, you can significantly improve your chances of receiving a positive credit assessment in the future.
