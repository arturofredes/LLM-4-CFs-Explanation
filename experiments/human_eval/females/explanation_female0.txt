Based on the analysis of the data and the rules derived from positive outcomes, here are some clear steps you can take to improve your chances of achieving a positive credit assessment:

### Key Factors Affecting Your Credit Assessment:

1. **Shorten Your Loan Duration**:
   - **Current Situation**: Your loan duration is 36 months.
   - **Recommendation**: Aim for a shorter loan duration. Loans with durations less than 36 months (e.g., 4, 10, or 19 months) have been associated with better credit outcomes. If possible, consider refinancing or negotiating for a shorter loan term.

2. **Personal Status and Sex**:
   - **Current Situation**: Your current status is female and divorced/separated/married.
   - **Recommendation**: While gender and personal status do play a role, this factor is less impactful than the loan duration. However, if you are married, it might be beneficial to ensure that your marital status is accurately reported.

3. **Other Debtors / Guarantors**:
   - **Current Situation**: You have a co-applicant.
   - **Recommendation**: Having a guarantor instead of a co-applicant has been linked to a better credit assessment. If possible, consider restructuring your loan to include a guarantor.

4. **Foreign Worker Status**:
   - **Current Situation**: You are listed as a foreign worker.
   - **Recommendation**: The data shows that being a non-foreign worker can improve credit assessments. While this may not be something you can change, it's important to ensure all other aspects of your credit profile are as strong as possible.

### Summary of Actions:

1. **Shorten Your Loan Duration**: Refinance or negotiate for a loan term shorter than 36 months.
2. **Review Your Personal Status**: Ensure your marital status is correctly reported.
3. **Consider a Guarantor**: If possible, replace your co-applicant with a guarantor.
4. **Strengthen Other Aspects of Your Profile**: While foreign worker status is a factor, focus on improving other areas that are within your control.

By making these strategic changes, you can significantly improve your chances of moving to a positive credit assessment.
