"Higher education levels (Masters, Doctorate) are associated with a positive income outcome. Even an Associate degree appears to influence the positive outcome.",5,0
"Gender alone does not have a consistent impact. Although the counterfactuals include both genders, there is one case where changing the gender to male resulted in a positive income outcome.",1,0
"The number of hours worked per week has a complex impact. While 40 hours per week is present in both negative and positive outcomes, an extremely low number of hours (7.0) also resulted in a positive outcome.",1,0
Age does not appear to be a decisive factor as individuals both older and the same age as the negative outcome still achieved a positive outcome.,0,1
"Being Self-Employed is associated with a positive income outcome even if the education level is higher. However, employment in the Private sector is not a definitive negative indicator, as it is present in both negative and positive outcomes.",1,1
"The occupation type 'White-Collar' is consistent across all cases, indicating that within this dataset, the specific occupation category might not be a determining factor for income prediction.",0,0
"Individuals with a Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate degree tend to have higher incomes compared to those with only Some-college education.",5,1
Gender transition from Female to Male is associated with higher income.,1,0
"There is no consistent pattern suggesting that age variations (37, 41, 43) significantly affect income, as long as education and other factors are favorable.",0,1
"Even within the same occupation (White-Collar), higher education and/or gender transition (to Male) lead to higher income.",5,0
Changing the workclass to 'Other/Unknown' with a higher education degree (Masters) leads to higher income.,1,0
Having a higher education level (Bachelors or above) increases the likelihood of earning more than $50k a year.,3,1
Being in a 'Professional' occupation increases the likelihood of earning more than $50k a year compared to a 'White-Collar' job.,1,1
Belonging to a race categorized as 'Other' increases the likelihood of earning more than $50k a year compared to being 'White'.,2,0
Being 'Male' increases the likelihood of earning more than $50k a year compared to being 'Female'.,1,0
"Either working significantly more hours (e.g., '88 hours') or fewer hours (e.g., '19 hours') per week can increase the likelihood of earning more than $50k a year. This suggests that both very high and very low hours have been observed in positive cases, likely due to different contexts such as high-paying part-time jobs or high-income full-time jobs.",2,0
Being 'Self-Employed' increases the likelihood of earning more than $50k a year compared to being employed in the 'Private' sector.,1,1
