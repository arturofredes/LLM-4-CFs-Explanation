"Marital status seems to have a variable impact, but positive outcomes are observed across different statuses including being Single and Divorced.",2,0
"While the workclass ""Private"" and occupation ""Blue-Collar"" do not seem to change the outcome significantly, being in a different workclass (e.g., ""Other/Unknown"") might have a positive effect.",1,0
"Age does not seem to have a significant impact on its own, as both younger (33) and older (78) individuals can achieve a positive outcome.",0,1
